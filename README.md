My name is Aman Raza, and I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science Engineering from Chandigarh University. As part of my academic and personal projects, 
I am developing a custom cryptocurrency token named "CRAFT" (CFT) on the Ethereum blockchain. This project involves creating a smart contract that enables the minting 
and burning of tokens, allowing for dynamic management of token supply and user balances. 
It reflects my interest in blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize digital finance.
